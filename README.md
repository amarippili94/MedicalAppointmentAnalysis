# MedicalAppointmentAnalysis
In this project I will be doing analysis on a public health institutions medical appointments dataset of more than 110k medical appointments. Here more than 30% of the appointments were a “No-Show”. The public health institutions can send multiple SMS notifications to the patients regarding their scheduled appointments in order to decrease the “No-Shows” percentage. But they wouldn’t want to waste their resources by sending the notifications to everyone, instead want to notify the patients who are most likely to be a “No-Show”. We must find a way to find the risk of a patient not showing up for a medical appointment.

You can find a detailed report in the document provided in the repository.
